# What are we not sharing?
Although configuration files (such as DATs, INIs, graphics, etc.) can be freely adjusted by anyone, the resource repository is fully functional to ensure all game features work smoothly. However, configuration values, like object positions on maps, weapon statistics, and spell balance, can be customized. This allows for flexibility while maintaining the core structure of the game intact.
